      <description>Now that we have authenticated users, let&amp;rsquo;s make an API for creating albums. These albums won&amp;rsquo;t have any photos in them just yet, just a name and an association with the username that created them, but it&amp;rsquo;s another clear step toward putting our app together.
To build our API we&#39;ll use [AWS AppSync](https://aws.amazon.com/appsync/), a managed GraphQL service for building data-driven apps. If you&#39;re not yet familiar with the basics of GraphQL, you should take a few minutes and check out [https://graphql.</description>
