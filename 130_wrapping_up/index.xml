      <description>While no application is really ever done, we&amp;rsquo;ve certainly come a long way toward building a shareable photo albums web app!
Here&amp;rsquo;s a reminder of everything we accomplished. We:
 Started with a simple React web app
 Added user authentication with a complete sign up and sign in flow
 Created a GraphQL API to securely manage photo albums backed by DynamoDB tables
 Added the ability to create and view albums</description>

      <description>Deleting via Amplify Amplify can do a pretty good job of removing most of the cloud resources we&amp;rsquo;ve provisioned for this workshop (just by attempting to delete the CloudFormation nested stack it provisioned). However, it will refuse to delete a few items, which we&amp;rsquo;ll manually take care of as well.
 From the photo-albums directory, run: amplify delete and press Enter to confirm the deletion.
 Wait a few minutes while Amplify deletes most of our resources.</description>
